# bruteforce

only brute-force (namefile = bruteforce.py): <br>
Generate a random password and use a function to try to brute-force that generated password.

zip password brute-force ((namefile = bruteforce-zip.py): <br>
The script performs a brute-force attack by trying each password from a predefined list until it successfully opens the ZIP file. This method is a basic approach and is only practical when the number of potential passwords is relatively small.
